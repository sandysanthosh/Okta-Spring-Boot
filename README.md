# Okta is a cloud identity and access management (IAM) 

Okta platform that can be integrated with a Spring Boot application for authentication and authorization.

Here are the steps to configure Okta in a Spring Boot application:

#### 1. Sign up for an Okta account: 
 
 If you don't already have one, sign up for an Okta account to get your API credentialsAdd the Okta SDK to your Spring Boot project: 

#### 2. Add the Okta SDK to your Spring Boot project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml file:
 
 ```
 
 <dependency>
  <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
  <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>

```

#### 3. Configure Okta properties:

Configure the Okta properties in your application.properties or application.yml file. 

Here is an example configuration:


```

okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id={clientId}
okta.oauth2.client-secret={clientSecret}
okta.oauth2.redirect-uri={redirectUri}
okta.oauth2.scopes=openid profile email


```


#### 4. Secure your endpoints: 

Secure your endpoints by adding the @PreAuthorize annotation to your controller methods. 

For example:

```

@GetMapping("/hello")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_profile')")
public String hello() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}


```

#### 5. Test your application: 

Run your application and test the authentication and authorization by accessing your secured endpoints.

These are the basic steps to configure Okta in a Spring Boot application. For more information and advanced configurations, refer to the Okta Spring Boot documentation.
